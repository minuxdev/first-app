1.  CREATING COMPONENTS 

Components are just typescript class's that are instanciated
by Angular. 
It MUST end with '.component.ts' and MUST contain:
    packages imports:
        witch add functions the component will use.
        
        e.g.    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    Decorator: 
        this is what hold the informations about the component`
        such as 'selector' and 'templateUrl'. It holds metadata
        that tells Angular to know what to do with the class.

        e.g     @Component({
                    selector: 'app-server';
                    templateUrl: './server.component.html' <<--- Must exits 
                                    in the same directory
                })

    
    Class:  
        is the class that is used by angular to lead all parts of this component.
       
        e.g     export class ServerComponent {
                    // some code here //
                }


    After creating, the component needs to be added into 'declarations' array
    so that Angular can recognize it and load.
    file: "src/app/app.module.ts"
    array: 'declarations'
    add:    'component'

    Also is important to make typescript recognize it and that is done by importing it
    e.g     import { ServerComponent } from './server/server.component';

    At this point, the component is ready to be used and to do it just add
    the <selector> into app.component.html. From here, every change made in 
    server.component.html will be rendered the app page.
    e.g     <app-server></app-server>
